# HustleEngine game makefile template
#
# The engine has a set of makefiles for the various target platforms,
# so the compilation is all taken care of on the engine side.
# 
# All that is needed is to list the game's 
# header directories and object files, the rest will be taken care of
# in the engine's makefiles.
